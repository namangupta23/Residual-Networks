# Residual-Networks

This notebook is a programming exercise of the Deep Learning Specialization by Deeplearning.ai. In this notebook, we will learn how to build very deep convolutional networks, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow us to train much deeper networks than were previously practically feasible.

**In this assignment, we will:**

- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification.
